# COVID Bayesian Network with Prolog

Code taken from  https://github.com/yunitarp/ReasoningTrainDisruptionWithProlog, with modification. Thanks god for these people.


## Usage
To run Prolog in the command line:

If you haven't installed SWI-Prolog, 
YOU ARE A DISAPPOINTMENT.

Jk, you can install it using this in the terminal:
```$ brew install swi-prolog```

Now to get started, you can:
1. Clone this repository to your local folder.
2. Run Prolog.
```
$ swipl user_interface.pl
```
You should see the `Welcome to SWI-Prolog` and the weird `?-` in your terminal now. 

3. We also charge consultation fees:
```
$ consult('rules.pl').
$ consult('bayesian_network.pl').
```
Remember the dots!!!

4. Run `menu.` in your terminal after consultation.

5. Enjoy :))
